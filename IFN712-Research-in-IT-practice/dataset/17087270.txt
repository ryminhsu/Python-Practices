All the Justin Bieber fans hitting me up, I don't know why Justin isn't following u but he loves all his fans and thank you for the support
Thank you for all the birthday love today I really appreciate everyone that took time to wish me well!  #Blessed
However, I am very happy to be in Finland, I never imagined being here and the love all the fans showed here is AMAZING!!!! #Meechy
So as we go through our days in life remember good always conquers evil. Stay positive, stay #meechy and remember #GoodGuysAlwaysWin
