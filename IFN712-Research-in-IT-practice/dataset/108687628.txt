some other artist would give a fuck about the religion and just go on with the show so they are finish, but not justin. i love him so much.
the fact that he stopped his concert because it was time for the turkish people to pray makes me love him even more. hes so respectful.
justin stopped the concert because the muslims had to pray. he respects their religion and i love how respectful he is. simply amazing.
