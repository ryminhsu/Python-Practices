SHRUGS
I heard Catwoman'ss working on her tell-all book about her romance with Batman and calling it "50 Shades of Batshit Crazy". I'm sorry.
We slowly wake
The sun is breaking thru our window
Our bodies intertwined from last night's
I whisper sweetly "make me some pancakes, bitch"
Show me on the doll where your wife doesn't touch you

I told them to leave a message on your answering machine or try you on your pager.
RT @mahatmatweeter: It's so refreshing to be on twitter for so long without having a life. That shit just gets in the way. Pfft at you life!
