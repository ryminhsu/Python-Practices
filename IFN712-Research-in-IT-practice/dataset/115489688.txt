Whoever is hating on @JBsDope because they're an emotional wreck cuz Justin unfollowed them needs to get punshed in the face.
Ain't got no ticket? You don't need one, just stand on the side and enjoy everything http://t.co/HXNAepq5JB
i saw this comment on youtube saying: "i was a bieber hater, but Justin Bieber's album 'believe' made me a fan", this comment made my day.
Justin showed tonight in Istanbul/Turkey how much he respects the muslim beliebers. BEST IDOL EVER
The OLLG tonight had to sit on a stool, it feels like my world tour again tbh, i need to cry
My mum just said "respect to justin bieber. he is amazing for what he did in Turkey" I LOVE U MUM!
she tried to sneak into Justin's hotel, she was all excited not knowing its her last day. #RIPMelissa
Justin stopped singing for a while because it was pray time because he wanted to show respect. LET ME LOVE YOU
i want to let go but something is holding me.
RT @justinbieber: Turkey was right. 4 more shows to go. Dubai is next. #believetour
Justin on the stage in Istanbul tonight http://t.co/J6uvCAtDzS
So it was pray time in Istanbul, Justin stopped singing for a while to show respect. MY IDOL EVERYONE
