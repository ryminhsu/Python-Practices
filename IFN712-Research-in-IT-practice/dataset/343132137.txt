Nothing comes easy in life, it takes hard work, dedication, and the ambition to accomplish your dreams.
A relationship with no trust is like a car with no gas. You can stay in it, but it won't go anywhere.
Love is like two people holding a rubber band, when one person lets go, it hurts the other one still holding on.
I like it when you smile, but I love it when I'm the reason.
Be truthful form the very beginning, don't build a relationship based on lies.
If they're stupid enough to walk away, be smart enough to let them go.
I can't help but smile every time your name shows up on my phone.
If you love someone, love them for who they are, not who you hope they will be.
A smart girl knows how to love, a smarter girl knows who to love.
#IDontUnderstandWhy you would text me first, and then not try to carry on a conversation.
Dear music, I will never be able to thank you enough for always being there for me.
Find a heart that will love you at your worst and arms that will hold you at your weakest.
This is why fast food scares the hell out of me... wow, this is messed up: http://t.co/CNV9pC8C6y
A person who truly loves you will never let you go or give up on you, no matter how hard the situation is.
Sometimes love makes you hold onto things you shouldn't.
