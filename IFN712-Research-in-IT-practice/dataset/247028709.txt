Have you ever wanted to go back in time and just change everything?
Why does everything taste much better at night?
I wish i could write أعتبرني أبنك والنبي  in my answers on the exam.
You know you're in love when all you want is to see that person happy, even if you're not part of their happiness.
Falling asleep with someone on your mind, waking up still on your mind.
Go where your mind takes you.
If it's still on your mind, it's still in your heart.
