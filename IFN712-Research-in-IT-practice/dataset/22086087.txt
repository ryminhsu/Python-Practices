everything in this world that you see manifested as form, is vibration. electricity, sound waves (music, speech, noise, etc.)...
fall in love with yourself first. then the planet you live on. THEN, other ppl.
not being able to do what you love because you can't afford to do it for fear of not making money at is is DISGUSTING.

RT @Deus_Ex_Human: I rly appreciate the people I communicate with on here, some, actually alot, of y'all are pretty damn good humans
we all have a buncha loved ones that all operate from a place of fear. they'll try to impose this on you unconsciously.
