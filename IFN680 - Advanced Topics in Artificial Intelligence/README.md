# Synposis
The project is a fundamental computer vision research on understanding the Siamese Network in image classification. In this research, our experiments focus on optimising model performance to be generalisation in image prediction by applying various machine learning techniques to mitigate the occurrence of under- and overfitting issues. The **code** presents the process of how we build models for experiments, while the **report** introduces important findings analysed by the experimental data. 
# Relevant Techniques
    Experimental Model: Siamese Network with Conventional Neural Network
    
    Overfitting Solutions
    - Regularisation L1/L2
    - Dropout
    - Early Termination

    Underfitting Solutions
    - Get more training data.
    - Increase the size or number of parameters in the model.
    - Upgrade the complexity of the model.
    - Boost the training time, until cost function is minimised.
