The project requires applying different data mining and exploration techniques to capture insightful information from Covid-19 datasets (D1.csv, D2.csv & D3.csv). The **code** records the entire process of our experiment, and the **report** elaborates on what we find in accordance with the analysis of experimental data. The experiment involves the following techniques:
		
	Data Mining Models:
	Association Mining, K-Mean & Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, Decision Tree, Logistics Regression, Neural Network

	Optimisation for Model Hyperparameters & Performance:
	K-Elbow, GridSearchCV, Feature Dimensionality Reduction, Ensemble Model

	Model Evaluation:
	Silhouette Coefficient, Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC curve

	Virtualisation for Analysis:
	Boxplot, Histogram, Dendrogram
