Project (a): Association mining to find hotspots based on a Patient Route Data

During the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea, the routes travelled by positive patients were reported. The “PatientRoute” dataset consists of 1509 observations where each observation presents a positive patient’s visit at a location and the time. There is a total of 891 unique patients and 151 unique locations.

Consider each patients’ route as a transaction in the dataset ‘D1.csv’ and build an association mining model on this dataset to identify what are the common routes that positive patients have travelled. The task is to conduct Association mining on this data set.

Answer the following concerning this data and analysis.
1. What variables did you include in the analysis? Justify your choice.
2. Does this dataset require any pre-processing before building the association mining model?
3. Conduct association mining and answer the following:
a. What is the ‘min_support’ threshold set and discuss why it is chosen?
b. Report the top 5 frequently occurring rules and interpret them.
4. Identify at least 10 common routes that positive patients from the Seoul province in the Dongjak-gu city have travelled.
5. Can you perform sequence analysis on this dataset? If yes, present your results. If not, rationalize why?
6. How the outcome of this study can be used by the decision-makers?
