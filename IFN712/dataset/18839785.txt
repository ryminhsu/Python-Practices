With lack of water &amp; iron ore if Guj can lead in agriculture &amp; steel industry, why canâ€™t nation, with perennial rivers &amp; iron ore deposits?
In 2005, our PM came to Guj &amp; announced a heritage path on Sabarmati-Dandi route. It has been 8 years but nothing has happened on that front

Both, the Government of India &amp; Government of Pakistan have misled people on Sarabjit Singh issue. The truth on this issue must come out.
Centre is unable to give a strong answer to Pakistan's inhuman acts. Beheading of our soldiers &amp; now Sarabjit's death are 2 recent examples.
Sarabjit's extra-judicial killing is yet another grim reminder that expecting Pakistan to follow due process of law in any sphere is futile.
Political untouchability is in nature of Congress. Ministers meeting other CMs are questioned &amp; Pakistan leaders are served chicken biryani!
