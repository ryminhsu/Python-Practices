# Synopsis
The project aims to filter the interests of users from tweets for grouping users who concern with similar topics. A comparative study focuses on unsupervised learning algorithms, as their advantages (e.g., less human intervention) indicate the promising capability in tweet mining. In this research, a data-driven experiment validates their performance on a real Twitter dataset to verify feasibility.
