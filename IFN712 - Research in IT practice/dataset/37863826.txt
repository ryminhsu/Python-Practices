Send me $15 and a self-addressed stamped envelope and I will send you an autographed copy of my pamphlet "How to Make Money On Twitter".
Twitter: where 20-year standup comedy vets get out-funnyed by accountants, college kids, junkies, &amp; unemployed single moms on a daily basis.
I'm jealous of how many friends the people on Intervention have.
I can't decide if I should get some new music or if I should get some more weed to make my old music sound new again.
