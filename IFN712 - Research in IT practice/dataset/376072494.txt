I love people who text back instantly.
Never lie to the person you love. Its not worth it and they don't deserve it
Don't just tell me you love me. SHOW ME!
You may miss them, but be strong, moving on is for the best.
I don't want anyone else to have your heart, kiss your lips, be in your arms, be the one you love. I don't want anyone to take my place.
Sometimes letting go is the only way you can see if something is really there.
You don't care, so why should I?
It's the worst feeling in the world to love and hate someone all at the same time.
Distance doesnâ€™t matter in love. What matters most, is your honesty and trust for that relationship to work out . http://t.co/Cw8qIXXl
"I love you" means that I will love you and stand by you even through the worst of times.
Feel free to use kisses as a method to shut me up anytime.
Promote what you love instead of bashing what you hate.
If you love someone, be sure to hold them close. If you don't, someone else will.
If you think it hurts that bad, don't talk about it, don't let it get you down. It's just one part of the story. Just let it go.
Someday, someone is going to thank you for letting me go.
The best feeling in the world is being loved back by the person you love.
#MentionSomeoneYourThankfulFor MOM. We might argue at times but her love for me never stops.
You make me smile for no reason, you make me laugh at unfunny things, but most of all, you make me love you when I shouldn't be loving you.
