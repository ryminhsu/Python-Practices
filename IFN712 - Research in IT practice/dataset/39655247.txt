You're my baby, my headache, my love, my smile, my frown, my wrong, my right, my pain, my happiness, my everything. You're MINE.
I'm comfortable with you when:

I'm weird with you

I sing whatever song comes into my mind

I say what's on my mind 

I talk nonsense.

I love you, no matter what.
All relationships go through shit, real relationships get through shit.
Dear #Oomf, When we first met, I had no idea you’d become this important to me. ??❤
A relationship where you can let your girlfriend/boyfriend go out with their friends and don't have to worry about them cheating &gt;
Being lied to &amp; cheated on changes you… ??
