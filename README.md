# Synopsis

The repository records three important data-driven experiments from my master's study. All of the codes transform to Jupyter Notebook style for straightforward reflection of the entire experimental process. The reports elaborate on findings in accordance with data analysis respectively. In this repository, IFN509 and IFN712 involve various techniques in text exploration and mining, while IFN680 is a computer vision project in image classification.
