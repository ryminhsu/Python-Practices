# Synopsis
The repository records three important data-driven experiments from my master's study. All of the codes are transformed into Jupyter Notebook style for straightforward reflection of the entire experimental process. The reports elaborate on how to analyse and summarise experimental data for findings.

IFN509 and IFN712 are involved with various techniques in text-based data exploration and mining, while IFN680 is designed for image classification. The file (Research Experience.pptx) briefly introduces IFN712 & IFN680 as a presentation view.
